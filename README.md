<img width="509" alt="nasapod" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22990146/37011470-52899908-20be-11e8-91af-8991a74b0957.PNG">

In this project, the picture of the day appears with the date it is related to.



## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery/AJAX

This was made with a simple ajax call. I retrieved the value from the input box and put it into a variable . The variable is concatenated to the url . The value is of a date which goes by year- month-date. After that, I switch the source of the image tag to whatever the picture of the day is. It appears on my html file. 

### Optimizations
When I have more time, I would go back to style it. Maybe also append some more information about the picture--for example--what is the location or description of this picture. 

#### Lessons Learned:
My first experience learning and reading API documentation. I learned about adding parameters to endpoints.
